# PHP Order form ðŸ›’

## ðŸš© Mission 

* Have a look at the provided structure: you get both an index file and another file containing a form. How are these two working together?
* Think of a funny / surprising / original name for a store that should definitely exist. (fancy suits for cats? bongo for dates? you name it!)
* Think of some products to sell (feel free to be creative) and update the products array with these.
* Check if all the products & prices are currently visible in the form.

### Must-have features
- Accepting orders:
    - Show an order confirmation when the user submits the form. This should contain the chosen products and delivery address).
- Validation:
    - Required fields are not empty.
    - Zip code are only numbers.
    - Email address is valid.
    - Show any problems (empty or invalid data) with the fields at the top of the form.
    - If the form was not valid, show the previous values in the form so that the user doesn't have to retype everything.
- Improve UX by saving user data:
    - Prefill the address (after the first usage), as long as the browser isn't closed.
- Expanding due to success
    - Make a second category of products, and provide a new array for this info.
    - The navigation should work as a toggle to switch between the two categories of products.
